# Power of Two

2048 Reinvented

## Description

Power of Two is a logic game inspired by the classic 2048, but with a twist. While retaining the core mechanics of merging tiles to reach higher numbers, Power of Two enhances the gameplay by introducing various types of tiles and altering the game's objectives.

## Features

- **Enhanced Mechanics:** Power of Two builds upon the original 2048 gameplay by introducing different types of tiles, adding depth and complexity to the game.
- **Multiple Levels:** Each level in Power of Two presents a unique challenge, requiring players to strategize and adapt their approach to reach the target number.
- **New Objectives:** Unlike the singular goal of reaching 2048 in the original game, Power of Two offers diverse objectives across its levels, providing players with a dynamic and engaging experience.

## How to Play

- **Objective:** The goal varies depending on the level. It could be reaching a specific number, clearing certain tiles, or achieving a particular pattern.
- **Merge Tiles:** Merge identical tiles by moving them in any direction (up, down, left, or right). When two tiles with the same number collide, they combine into one tile with the sum of their values.
- **Strategy:** Plan your moves carefully to maximize your score and progress towards the level's objective.
  Levels: Progress through the game by completing each level's objectives. Each level presents a new challenge and introduces unique mechanics.

## Motivation

This game is created as a part of [Backdrop Build](https://backdropbuild.com/).

In creating Power of Two, I wanted to show fellow web developers that game development isn't some distant, mysterious realmâ€”it's just another playground for our skills. That's why I went with React for those snazzy interfaces we all love, Typescript for keeping things nice and tidy, and Vite for bundling it all up fast. And let's not forget Vitest for making sure everything runs smoothly. By sharing this open repository, my hope is to spark some inspiration. Whether you're a seasoned coder or just getting started, don't be afraid to dive into game development! Who knows what awesome stuff you'll come up with?
